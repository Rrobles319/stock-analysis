# Stock-Analysis-2nd Module Repo (VBA)

## Overview of Project:
Steve is researching stock return data for a number of green energy stocktickers and he would like to expand his date set to include the entire stock market.

### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We will be refactoring Steve's code to run through data set once. The purpose of this analysis is to shorten VBA script run time by writing a more effecient, logical code. 

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
In just over 0.7 seconds, running our AllStocksAnalysis(Refactored) Macro concludes 2017 was exponentially more profitable for these 12 green energy stock while 2018 was not. The critical diffenece between original and refactored code is the implementation of additional arrays.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

-**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
-**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

The advantages of refactoring code is twofold:creating more elegant, readable code and saving time. One disadvantage of refactoring code is the time required to work through bugs.
In some instances, running original code may prove to be the best time saver.
Pertaining to the original VBA script, refactoring enhanced script run time by about 8%-12% saving Steve plenty of time in analysis as he expands his data set. Uncertain if refactoring this original VBA script would save more time than what it took to work through bugs.
